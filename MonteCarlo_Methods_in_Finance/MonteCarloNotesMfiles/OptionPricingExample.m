%% Monte Carlo Option Pricing
% This MATLAB script shows how to use Monte Carlo methods to price a
% financial derivative or option.  An option gives the right, but not the
% obligation, to conduct some transaction at a future date.

%% Plot historical data
% Here we load in the historical adjusted daily closing prices of a stock
% and plot the most recent year's data.  The data were obtained from
% <http://finance.yahoo.com> for GOOG for the period ending May 19, 2015.

load stockPriceHistory.txt -ascii %load one year of stock price data into memory
S0 = stockPriceHistory(end); %stock price today
Delta = 1/250; %daily time increment in years
timeBefore = (-249:0) * Delta; %daily monitoring for one year prior to today
plot(timeBefore, stockPriceHistory,'-',0,S0,'.') %plot history
xlabel('Time, \(t\), in years\hspace{5ex}') %add labels
ylabel('Stock Price, \(S(t)\), in dollars') %to identify the axes
axis([-1 1 300 900]) %set reasonable scales for axes
print -depsc StockHistory.eps %print the plot to a .eps file

%% Estimate drift and volatility
% Although we know the past, we do not know the future.  However, we can
% use historical data to build a random (stochastic) model of the future.
% Let \(S(t)\) denote the price of this stock at time \(t\) measured in
% years.  The geometric Brownian motion model of a stock price says that 
% 
% \[ S(t+\Delta ) = S(t) \exp( \Delta m + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta} Z ), \]
%
% where 
% 
% * \(\Delta = 1/250\) is the _time increment_ (250 trading days per year), 
% * \(m\) is a constant _drift_, 
% * \(\sigma\) is the constant _volatility_, and 
% * \(Z\) is a Gaussian (normal) random variable with zero mean and unit
% variance. 
%
% For the data that we have, \((t_j,S(t_j)),\ j=-249, -248, \ldots, 0\),
% the relationship between stock prices at successive times can be written
% as
% 
% \[ \log\biggl(\frac{S(t_{j+1})}{S(t_{j})} \biggr) = \log(S(t_{j+1} )) -
% \log(S(t_j)) = \Delta m + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta} Z_j, \]
%
% where the \(Z_j\) are independent and identically distributed (IID)
% \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\).  This means that we can estimate \(\Delta m\) and
% \(\sigma^2 \Delta\) by the sample mean and variance of the difference of
% the logged stock price data:
%
% \[ \Delta m  = \frac{1}{249} \sum_{j=-249}^{-1}
% \log\biggl(\frac{S(t_{j+1})}{S(t_{j})} \biggr), \qquad  \sigma^2 \Delta =
% \frac{1}{248} \sum_{j=-249}^{-1}
% \biggl[\log\biggl(\frac{S(t_{j+1})}{S(t_{j})} \biggr) - \Delta m
% \biggr]^2, \qquad t_j = \frac{j}{250}. \]

diffLogStockPrice = diff(log(stockPriceHistory)); %difference of the log of the stock prices
scDrift = mean(diffLogStockPrice); %sample mean
drift = scDrift/Delta %estimated drift
scVolatility = std(diffLogStockPrice); %sample standard deviation
volatility = scVolatility/sqrt(Delta) %estimated volatility

%%
% The interesting part comes next!

%% Future price movement
% Next we use these estimated quantities to plot scenarios representing
% what this stock might do in the future.  We set up times looking half a
% year, \(T\), ahead: 

d = 125; %look at d new time steps
timeAfter = (1:d) * Delta; %time steps ahead
timeFinal = timeAfter(end); %final time

%%
% Next we program a function that computes \(n\) possible future scenarios,
% i.e., stock price paths, \(S(T/d), S(2T/d), \ldots, S(T)\):

SVal = @(n) S0*exp(bsxfun(@plus, ... %bsxfun is a great way to operate on one vector and one matrix
   drift*timeAfter, ... %the time varying part
   scVolatility * cumsum(randn(n,d),2))); %randn produces Gaussian random numbers
n1 = 20; %small number of paths
stockVal = SVal(n1); %generate some paths into the future
hold on %this prevents erasing the plot when something new is added
plot([0 timeAfter],[repmat(S0,n1,1) stockVal],'-', ...
   [timeFinal timeFinal],[300 900],'k--'); %plot the future scenarios
text(0.47,220,'\(T\)') %label the final time
print -depsc StockHistoryPlusFewForward.eps %print the plot to a .eps file

%%
% Which one of these is correct?  In fact, there are infinitely many
% possibilities.  This time let's plot more and look at the histogram.

n = 1e4;
stockVal = [stockVal; SVal(n-n1)]; %generate a large number of paths
h = plot([0 timeAfter],[repmat(S0,n-n1,1) stockVal(n1+1:n,:)]); %plot a large number of paths
if str2double(getfield(ver('MATLAB'), 'Version')) >= 8.4 %the next part only works for later versions of MATLAB
   [binCt,binEdge] = histcounts(stockVal(:,d)); %compute a histogram of the stock prices at the final time
   nBin = numel(binCt); %number of bins used
   MATLABblue = [0 0.447 0.741]; %the RGB coordinates of the default MATLAB blue for plotting
   h = [h; patch(timeFinal + [0; reshape([binCt; binCt],2*nBin,1); 0]*(0.4/max(binCt)), ... %x values
      reshape([binEdge; binEdge], 2*nBin+2, 1), ... %y values
      MATLABblue,'EdgeColor',MATLABblue)]; %plot the histogram patch
end
print -depsc StockHistoryPlusFutureScenarios.eps %print the plot to a .eps file

%%
% Note that this distribution of final stock prices is skewed towards the
% higher values.  The value of \(S(T)\) can be arbitrarily high, but may be
% no less than zero.

%% European option pricing
% A European option comes in two types, call and put, and pays an amount at
% the time of expiry, \(T\).  The payoff depends on the final price of the
% stock:
%
% \[
% \begin{array}{rcc}
% & \text{call} & \text{put} \\ \hline
% \text{payoff} & \max(S(T) - K,0) & \max(K - S(T),0) 
% \end{array}
% \]
%
% Here, \(K\) denotes an agreed upon _strike price_.  The future stock
% price path is a random (stochastic) process, so \(S(T)\) is random, and
% the option payoff is random. Although we cannot know the actual future
% payoff, we can try to compute the fair price of the option, which is the
% expected value or mean of the payoff.  In fact, there is a small wrinkle.
% Because money today is generally worth more than money in the future, the
% fair price of the option is the expected value of the payoff times a
% discounting factor that depends on the prevailing riskless interest rate,
% \(r\), i.e.,
%
% \[ \text{fair price} = \mathbb{E}(\text{payoff}\times \mathrm{e}^{-rT}). \]
%
% One way to estimate this mean is by the sample mean of the many payoffs.
% Let \(Y_i\) denote the payoff of the option according to the \(i\)th
% random stock path.  Then the approxmate fair price is
%
% \[ \text{approximate fair price} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i
% \mathrm{e}^{-rT} = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n
% \max(S_i(T) - K,0) \mathrm{e}^{-rT}, & \text{call}, \\ \displaystyle
% \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \max(K - S_i(T),0) \mathrm{e}^{-rT}, &
% \text{put}. \end{cases} \]
%
% There is a relationship between the riskless interest rate and the drift, which is
% 
% \[m = r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \]
%
% This allows us to estimate the interest rate.  Let's try to price a
% European call option with a strike price of \(K = \$600\).

K = 600; %strike price
delete(h) %delete lots of paths to make the figure simple again
plot([-1 timeFinal],[K K],'--k') %plot the strike price
text(0.53,590,'\(K\)') %label the final time
print -depsc StockHistoryPlusFuturePlusStrike.eps

%% 
% All the paths that end up above \(K = \$600\) have a positive payoff.
% Some paths will yield a positive payoff and others will not.

interest = drift + volatility^2/2 %interest rate
Yval = max(stockVal(:,d) - K, 0) * exp(-interest * timeFinal); %payoffs
euroCallPrice = mean(Yval); %estimated option price
CLTCIwidth = 2.58*std(Yval)/sqrt(n); %width of confidence interval
disp(['The option price = $' num2str(euroCallPrice,'%6.3f') ...
   ' +/- $' num2str(CLTCIwidth,'%6.3f')]) %display output

%%
% We can try again, this time measuring the time taken.

tic %start the timer
stockVal = SVal(n); %generate a large number of new paths
Yval = max(stockVal(:,d) - K, 0) * exp(-interest * timeFinal);
euroCallPrice = mean(Yval); %estimated option price
CLTCIwidth = 2.58*std(Yval)/sqrt(n); %width of confidence interval
disp(['The option price = $' num2str(euroCallPrice,'%6.3f') ...
   ' +/- $' num2str(CLTCIwidth,'%6.3f')]) %display output
toc %output the time elapsed since the last tic

%%
% These two approximations to the one option price are similar, but not the
% same.  This is because we are using a random or Monte Carlo algrorithm

%% Discussion
%
% * The accuracy of our approximation to the option price depends on the
% number of stock price paths used, \(n\).  We will discuss this dependence
% and how to choose \(n\) to obtain the desired accuracy in MATH 565.
%
% * This example looks at one of the simplest options to price.  However,
% note that one can consider options where they payoff is a more
% complicated function of the stock path, \(S(T/d), S(2T/d), \ldots,
% S(T))\), and the Monte Carlo method will work the same way.  We explore
% some of these other options in MATH 565.
%
% * The geometric Brownian motion model for the stock price may not capture
% the real world best.  Other models for the stock price path can be used,
% and the Monte Carlo method still works.  We explore some of these models
% in MATH 565.
%
% * There are exact formulas for prices of European put and call options
% with this geometric Brownian motion stock price paths. One does not
% really need Monte Carlo to price them, but Monte Carlo is needed for more
% sophisticated options.  We considered European options for the sake of
% simplicity.
%
% * We used simple IID sampling.  If one is careful, other sampling schemes
% may be used to obtain the desired answer in less time, i.e., with fewer
% samples. We explore some of these methods for improving efficiency in
% MATH 565.
%
% * Some of the procedures that we wrote from scratch have been
% incorporated into the Guaranteed Automatic Integration Library (GAIL)
% <http://gailgithub.github.io/GAIL_Dev/>, which you will be using in MATH
% 565.
