%% Late for a Date
%
% This example demonstrates the confidence intervals for probabilities and
% quantiles assuming that you must take different modes of transportation
% to get to your date.
%
% You leave your office and walk to the parking lot.  You then drive to
% Chinatown, park your car, and walk to MingHin restaurant to meet your
% friends.  For illustration purposes, we assume that the times of each
% segment are distributed uniformly:
%
% \begin{align*}
% T_1  &= \text{ time to walk to your car } \sim \mathcal{U}[4,7], \\
% T_2  &= \text{ time to drive to Chinatown } \sim \mathcal{U}[10,15], \\
% T_3  &= \text{ time to park your car } \sim \mathcal{U}[0,12], \\
% T_4  &= \text{ time to walk to Ming Hin } \sim \mathcal{U}[2,8], \\
% T_{\text{total}}  &= \text{ total travel time } = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_4.
% \end{align*}
% 
% All times are given in minutes.  We want to know 
%
% * what is the average time required to get to your date, 
% * what is the probability of needing more than \(35\) minutes to get to
% your date, and
% * what is the time you need to leave by to guarantee with \(98\%\)
% confidence that you will be on time.

%% Simulating travel times
% First we construct a function that generates IID travel times.  If $U_1,
% \ldots, U_4$ are IID $\mathcal{U}[0,1]$ random variables, then 
%
% \begin{align*}
% T_1  &= 4 + 3 U_1, \\
% T_2  &= 10 + 5 U_2, \\
% T_3  &= 12 U_3, \\
% T_4  &= 2 + 6 U_4, \\
% T_{\text{total}}  & = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_4 = 16 + 3U_1 + 5U_2 + 12U_3 + 6 U_4.
% \end{align*}

Ttot = @(n) 16 + sum(bsxfun(@times,rand(n,4),[3 5 12 6]),2);

%% The average travel time
% The average travel time can be easily calculated analytically: 
% 
% \[
% \mu  = \mathbb{E}(T_{\text{total}}) = 16 + (3 + 5 + 12 + 6) \mathbb{E}(U)
% = 16 + 26 \times 1/2 = 29.
% \]
%
% Monte Carlo methods can be used to approximate this as well:

tic
muhat = meanMC_g(Ttot,0.01,0) %IID Monte Carlo with absolute error of 0.01

%% The probability of being late
% If we only leave our office \(29\) minutes before our date, we will
% sometimes be early and sometimes be late.  

n = 1e4; %number of samples
lateTime = 29; %what time is considered late
Ttotval = Ttot(n); %sample of n total times
lateDateBinCI = binomialCI(n,sum(Ttotval > lateTime)) %confidence interval for being too late

% Since this is an important date we plan to leave \(35\) minutes
% beforehand and hope to be early or on time. What is the chance that we
% will be late?
%
% We now perform \(n\) trials, and count the number of late dates.  Then we
% use |binomialCI| to compute a confidence interval on the probability of
% being late for the date given that you leave \(35\) minutes beforehand.

n = 1e4; %number of samples
lateTime = 35; %what time is considered late
Ttotval = Ttot(n); %sample of n total times
lateDateBinCI = binomialCI(n,sum(Ttotval > lateTime)) %confidence interval for being too late

%%
% The chance is of being late is around \(8\%\).

%% The cut-off time for being on time with a high probability
% A related problem is determining how late we can leave our office and
% still get to the restaurant on time with a high probability, say,
% \(98\%\).  Now we use |quantileCI| as follows:

p = 0.02; %the probability of lateness that can be tolerated
extremeVal = [16 42]; %the extreme values of the distribution
lateDateQuantCI = quantileCI(1-p,Ttotval,extremeVal) %1-p quantile for total travel times

%%
% The worst \(2\%\) travel time is around \(36.7\) to \(38\) minutes.  You
% need to allow \(38\) minutes to make sure that you will be on time with
% at least a \(98\%\) probability.
